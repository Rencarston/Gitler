          <h3>Italian pizza is the most photographed food in the world</h3>
          <p>
            And since most foodies took up the habit of taking a shot of their
            food and Instagramming it before eating, Photobox also looked at the
            10 most photographed foods in the world. Using hashtags from the
            app, the online photo printing company found that pizza was the most
            photographed food out of their data, with over 64,000,000 hashtags.
            Right behind it, still on the podium: ramen and burgers.

          <h3>Paella is a rice dish originally from Valencia</h3>
          <p>
            While non-Spaniards commonly view it as Spain's national dish,
            Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the
            Valencian region. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their
            identifying symbols. It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish
            cuisine.

          <h3>
            Moussaka is an eggplant- or potato-based dish, often including
            ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East,
            with many local and regional variations
          </h3>
          <p>
            The best-known version in Europe and the Americas is the Greek
            variant created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes. Many versions
            have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg
            (custard) or flour (béchamel sauce). In Greece, the dish is layered
            and typically served hot. Tselementes also proposed a vegan variant
            for orthodox fast days. Romania also has a vegan version that
            replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.
